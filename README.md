A fun Google Chrome extension I am making. Here's hoping that it'll work well!</br>

# Todo:

_ complete Manifest </br>

X make popup.js </br>

_ test alarm API </br>

_ test notification API </br>

_ try out using scripting for a alarm.js file or something <br>

_ test out different listeners to see which ones apply to what I need <br>

_ test out different input devices <br>
